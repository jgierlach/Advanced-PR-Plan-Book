      <p>We recognize that Campus Ministries has a large presence and reach on campus. As a whole, they play a necessary role in the success of spiritual growth of the Hope College community.</p>

      <p>As a PR firm, we are excited about the opportunity to partner with Campus Ministries and utilize their desire to grow their department in a way that reflects the mission of Campus Ministries and Hope College.</p>

      <p>
        We have developed five core focus areas in which we believe will better the success of Campus Ministries as a department. We want to increase
        <strong>followers</strong>,
        <strong>attendance</strong>, and
        <strong>practices</strong>, while establishing the future of Campus Ministries and Trygve Johnsons brand. Through our visions for the Campus Ministries brand and Trygve Johnson’s brand, we expect to see a positive advancement in
        <strong>follower base</strong>,
        <strong>attendance</strong>, and
        <strong>practices</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>Our Focus is to work both internal and external factors to create a five star program. This plan will need to be carried out for the next four years in order for it to embed itself fully on Hope’s Campus.</p>

      <p>Our first goal is to increase the follower count on all Campus Ministries Social Platforms. A lack of knowledge can sometimes be the cause of lack of community engagement, so by reaching as many people as we can we will be increasing the chances of campus ministries being used more frequently.</p>

      <p>Our second goal is to increase Hope College’s enrollment. Because campus ministries is a five star program it will attract more prospective students to Hope enrollment.</p>

      <p>The third goal is to increase communication practices at Campus Ministries. Majority of departments on Hope’s campus has a communication specialist that works with Public Affairs and Marketing on behalf of that department (i.e. Family and Alumni Engagement Office, Boerigter Center for Calling and Career, and the Development Office). All three of the prior offices motivate prospective students to choosing Hope. If Campus Ministries had such a position, the job would contribute to Campus Ministries as a five star program.</p>

      <p>Lastly, we want to help Campus Ministries establish their future. We will do this by shifting the perception of the success of Hope College Campus Ministries to something other colleges Campus Ministries can aspire to be. Colleges all across the country will model their own programs after Hope College’s Campus Ministries.</p>

      <p>Secondly, to establish Trygve Johnsons brand. By working on Trygve’s brand it will have a positive effect not only for Trygve but for Hope College Campus Ministries. Trygve’s brand will be an asset of Campus Ministries but not entirely Campus Ministries. Doing so, his personal followers will migrate to the Campus Ministries brand and vice versa.</p>

      <p>Our strategy is rooted in discussion with Campus Ministries, students, and Dr. Hearit. We are motivated by the enthusiasm Campus Ministries presents with their desire to grow and develop their department. By creating these strategies we will be able to help campus ministries become a five star, golden standard.</p>
