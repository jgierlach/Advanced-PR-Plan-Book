      <br />

      <p>
        We recognize that Campus Ministries has a large presence and reach on
        campus. As a whole, they play a necessary role in the success of
        spiritual growth of the Hope College community.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a PR firm, we are excited about the opportunity to partner with
        Campus Ministries and utilize their desire to grow their department in a
        way that reflects the mission of Campus Ministries and Hope College.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have developed five core focus areas in which we believe will better
        the success of Campus Ministries as a department. We want to increase
        <strong>followers</strong>, <strong>attendance</strong>, and
        <strong>practices</strong>, while establishing the future of Campus
        Ministries and Trygve Johnsons brand. Through our visions for the Campus
        Ministries brand and Trygve Johnson’s brand, we expect to see a positive
        advancement in <strong>follower base</strong>,
        <strong>attendance</strong>, and <strong>practices</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our focus is to work on both internal and external factors to create a
        five star program. This plan will need to be carried out for the next
        four years in order for it to embed itself fully on Hope’s Campus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our first goal is to increase the follower count on all Campus
        Ministries social media platforms. A lack of knowledge can sometimes be
        the cause of lack of community engagement, so by reaching as many people
        as we can we will be increasing the chances of campus ministries social
        media and resources being used more frequently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our second goal is to increase Hope College’s enrollment. Because campus
        ministries is a five star program it will attract more prospective
        students to Hope enrollment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third goal is to increase communication practices at Campus
        Ministries. Majority of departments on Hope’s campus has a communication
        specialist that works with Public Affairs and Marketing on behalf of
        that department (i.e. Family and Alumni Engagement Office, Boerigter
        Center for Calling and Career, and the Development Office). All three of
        the prior offices motivate prospective students to choosing Hope. If
        Campus Ministries had such a position, the job would contribute to
        Campus Ministries as a five star program.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last, we want to help Campus Ministries establish its future. We will do
        this by enhancing perceptions of the success of Hope College Campus
        Ministries. By better promoting Campus Ministries, we hope to establish
        the Hope College Campus Ministries program as something other colleges
        look to for leadership and guidance. Colleges all across the country
        will model their own programs after Hope College’s Campus Ministries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, we want to better establish a brand for Trygve Johnson. By
        working on Trygve’s brand, it has a positive effect not only for Trygve
        but for Hope College Campus Ministries. The development of Trygve’s
        brand is an asset to Campus Ministries. Doing so, his personal followers
        will migrate to the Campus Ministries brand and vice versa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our strategy is rooted in discussion with Campus Ministries, current
        Hope College students, and Dr. Hearit. By utilizing these strategies we
        propose, we will be able to help Campus Ministries become a gold
        standard for collegiate campus ministry programs.
