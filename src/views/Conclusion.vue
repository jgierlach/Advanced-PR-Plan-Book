      <p>
        The Not Just a Church campaignâ€™s main goal is to increase Campus
        Ministries presence on Social Media. Through extensive research done as
        a PR firm we can conclude that 62% of survey respondents did not follow
        Campus Ministries on social media but in the end over half of our
        respondents answered probably yes or definitely yes to wanting to use
        Campus Ministries resources in the future. To have success with this
        campaign the target publics of students, faculty and staff, prospective
        students and families, current families, alumni, community organizations
        and the city of Holland must be targeted. By hiring on a Communication
        Specialist for Campus Ministries, information will be more effectively
        communicated through social media. The campaign serves two major
        components for generating more followers on social media to better
        inform and draw people to Campus Ministries.

        Our target publics are divided into two groups of internal and external.
        The first group of target publics our internal are Students, Faculty and
        Staff. This group is one the top priorities as they are the ones
        directly connected and benefiting from Campus Ministries resources. The
        second group are our external target publics which are prospective
        students and families, current families, alumni, community organizations
        and the city of Holland. Our external target publics are going to allow
        Campus Ministries to become a gold star standard through their positive
        experiences and reviews of the program.
      </p>

        The campaign budget will mostly be allocated towards the job creation of
        Communication specialist. Some promotional ad purchases may be made on
        social media to help increase followers.

        We realize that our campaign focuses on shifting a perspective and
        gaining engagement. Those two elements are products of time. This
        campaign will need a full year to produce changed results. If suggested
        tactics are carried out we foresee positive change happening by May
        2021. For a full perspective of internal target publics to change a full
        4 years may be the ultimate result to see a changed perception of Campus
        Ministries based of off the implemented tactics. In the end to get a
        good measure on the effectiveness of Not Just a Church campaign, looking
        at increased social media accounts will give a good indication but also
        sending out a questionnaire that would give targeted publics feedback on
        the new changes implemented to the program.
