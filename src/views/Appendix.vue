      <h3>Final Summary:</h3>

      <p>
        From extensive research done on Campus Ministries, our PR team has
        engaged in quantitative and qualitative data collection. This extensive
        research was conducted through a survey made on Qualtrics software
        platform as well as secondary research done on surrounding schools and
        their ministries programs. An in-depth analysis of Hope College Campus
        Ministries social media platforms was also done. Myself engaged in
        Chapel and Gathering services that Campus Ministries offers on Hope
        Collegeâ€™s Campus. Through online surveys and personal research, we are
        educated enough to inform Campus Ministries of the most effective
        communication campaign to conduct.
      </p>

      <h3>Some key takeaways from the Qualtrics survey were:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Almost 50% of our respondents attend a Chapel service 1 to 3 times per
          week.
        </li>
        <li>
          The strongest two social media platforms were Instagram and Apple
          Music.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lack of knowledge is the main cause of lack of social media followers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over half of our respondent answered probably yes or definitely yes to
          wanting to use Campus Ministries resources in the future.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />

      <p>
        Campus Ministries was founded on providing a community when community
        was lacking on campus. Though numbers seem to be consistent with Chapel,
        I saw a lack of student attendance at the Gathering service. Through
        personal attendance and secondary research, I can conclude that there
        is:
      </p>

      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Lack of knowledge of The Gathering thus resulting in low attendance
          numbers
        </li>
        <li>Lack of marketing or outside influence to draw students in</li>
      </ol>
