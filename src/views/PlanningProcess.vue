      Not just a Church campaign was developed using primary and secondary data
      gathered from a survey and publically available data. After hearing Trygve
      Johnson discuss Campus Ministries, we identified eight target publics:
      Students (internal), Faculty and Staff (internal), Prospective students
      and families (external), Current Families (external), Alumni (external),
      Influencers and Networks (external), Organization we want to be associated
      with (external), Holland (external). This campaign is focused on both
      external and internal audience members. Campus Ministries wants to grow
      and expand the program and sees this done efficiently through external
      factors. External PR and Campus Ministries want to see the program become
      the gold star standard for surrounding communities. At External PR we want
      to see Campus Ministries grow thus to promote chrisitanity and increase
      the success of the college.

      In our survey, participants were asked information regarding their own
      religion, why they choose Hope, and their views on Campus Ministries. Many
      respondents identified with the Christian faith, choose Hope for its
      academics and felt that Campus Ministries was very relevant on campus.
      Many questions were asked to better understand who and how many people
      Campus Ministries is reaching with its social media. At External PR we see
      the amazing tool that social media is to drive business to the next level.
      As a team we will create and produce content that will appeal to the
      target publics and introduce more to what Campus Ministries is and will
      be.

      Though Campus Ministries has a Christian foundation, it wants to reach all
      people and communities. Campus Ministries truly is Not Just a Church.
      Through a communication campaign, we hope to give Campus Ministries the
      tools it needs to highlight it is a top tier Christian community, and
      therefore influence admissions and public perception. From our research,
      we concluded both the Holland and Hope College community wants to see an
      increase personal involvement in Campus Ministries. Every strategy,
      objective and tactic in our campaign ties back to our main goal of
      promoting Campus Ministries nationally, and increase the success of Hope
      College.
