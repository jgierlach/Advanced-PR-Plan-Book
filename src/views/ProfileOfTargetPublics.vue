        Campus Ministries wants to hit eight key publics. Campus Ministries
        wants to have an internal and external effect on the surrounding
        audience.

        Campus Ministries is not just for Christians. Though its foundations are
        based on Jesus Christ, Campus Ministries wants to serve as a community
        for people to gather.

        Hope College serves to a little over 3,000 students. Of the 3,000
        students attending Hope College, almost 1,000 identify with some form of
        Christianity. Of these 3,000 students, approximately 2,000 are from the
        State of Michigan. Only 126 students in our survey identified as
        areligious. As a team, we concluded that the students and surrounding
        communities have some religious influence or emphasis on the community
        and people. With this conclusion we can see how Campus Ministries can
        and will have an impact on the target audiences involved.

        Internally, Campus Ministries wants to continue to better serve the
        students, faculty and staff of Hope College. However, Campus Ministries
        sees the impact it can have on external publics. For example, Campus
        Ministries wants to be a selling point for prospective students when
        deciding to choose Hope College. Our campaign proposes specific ways in
        which Hope College Campus Ministries can better reach external
        audiences, specifically through a strategic social media campaign.

        Our budget was designed in recognition that Campus Ministries staff and
        faculty have a limited amount of time and financial resources to
        implement this plan. In addition, this campaign was designed to repeat
        at different time periods. However, some aspects of the campaign (such
        as a website redesign) will not have to be repeated each time you run
        the campaign, which leaves even more money to spare.
