        Campus Ministries is not just for Christians. Though it’s foundations
        are based on Jesus Christ, campus ministries wants to serve as a
        community for people to gather. This foundational base goes all the way
        back to its original founding goal.

        Hope College serves to a little over 3000 students. Of the 3000 students
        attending almost 1000 identify with some form of Christianity. Of these
        3000 students a little over 2000 are from the state of michigan. Only
        126 students identified as “none” when asked about religion. As a team
        we can conclude that the students and surrounding communities have some
        religious influence or emphasis on the community and people. With this
        conclusion we can see how Campus Ministries can and will have an impact
        on the target audiences involved.

        Internally Campus Ministries wants to continue to better serve the
        students, faculty and staff of Hope College. They have chosen to spend
        their time and money at this educational institution so they are top
        priority.
      </p>

      <p>
        Campus Ministries sees the impact they can have on external publics, and
        in result can have individually for Campus Ministries and Hope College
        as a whole. Campus Ministries wants to be a selling point for
        prospective students to choose Hope College. Though internally students
        have invested their time into Hope College Campus Ministries, they also
        want to continue to serve the families that allow Hope College to
        continue to grow and educate.

        Campus Ministries wants to remember those who have helped establish the
        program that it is today. Campus Ministries wants to continue to give
        back to alumni that have supported its program throughout the year.
        Surrounding church groups have an impact on the same kids that Hope
        College sees walk through campus each day. By creating a stronger
        relationship between outside communities both religious and non
        religious in Holland, will help in the increase success of Campus
        Ministries.
