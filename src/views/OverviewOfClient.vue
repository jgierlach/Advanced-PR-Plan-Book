      <h1>History</h1>

      <p>
        Campus ministries has a rich history on Hopeâ€™s campus. Founded, in 1862
        Campus Ministries has found itself in 3 different phases.
        <strong>Campus Ministries 1.0:</strong> The Pioneer Season was the
        catalyst for many phases to come. People were planning what was going to
        become of Campus Ministries. The department was able to stake land which
        would now be referenced as the Keppel House.

      <p>
        Campus Ministries rebuilt worship walls and created Chapel and The
        Gathering. This new vision was being formed of what Campus Ministries
        was and where it was going.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1993, the school endowed a Dean of Chapel. Hope currently has the
        third Dean of Chapel, Trgve Johnson.

      <p>
        The perfect storm has been created with individual groups needing a
        place to gather. The era of pop worship music had just been created and
        students really resonated with the worship.

      <p>
        We have transitioned to
        <strong>Campus Ministries 2.0:</strong> Settlement Season (2005). Trygve
        Johnson was brought on board and wanted to make Campus Ministries truly
        apart of Hope College. He wanted to make this revolution that was
        happening with Campus Ministries into an institution. The culture Campus
        Ministries was creating Trgve wanted to see be carried out. The language
        and symbols that were being used Campus Ministries really wanted to be
        shaped into their culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're now in <strong>Campus Ministries 3.0:</strong> The Outreach
        Season. Campus Ministries wants to reach higher education not just at
        the Hope Community. Campus Ministries wants to continue to be leaders
        and do new things. Campus Ministries is able to serve more people and
        communities with its newly built Van Andel Huys Der Hope Campus
        Ministries building.

        This space will equip the students to be the leaders for the next
        generation. Campus Ministries wants to continue to create and produce
        new resources and experiences for its audience.
