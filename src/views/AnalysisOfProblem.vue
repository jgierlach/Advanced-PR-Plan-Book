      <br />

      <p>
        <strong>1)</strong> The volume of high quality content that Campus
        Ministries produces is truly impressive. CM produces places for people
        to gather, resources to help nurture, and the tools to send each
        individual off into the world as a global citizen. It then disseminates
        this content across 11 different outlets and 6 different platforms that
        Campus Ministries currently uses to distribute the media it creates.
        <strong
          >However, the uncentralized publication of content presents a
          challenge of accessibility when it comes to the various publics that
          Campus Ministries is hoping to reach.</strong
        >
        62% of our survey respondents do not follow any of the Campus Ministries
        social media (i.e. Campus Ministries on Twitter, Instagram, Campus
        Ministries Athletics and Team X, Y, or Z on Instagram).
        <strong
          >The distribution of Campus Ministries message and mission would be
          more effective if the channels were consolidated and branded in such a
          way that all their media was accessible in one place.</strong
        >

        <strong>2)</strong> Hope College has seen a decrease in attendance from
        Fall 2018 to Fall 2019. In Fall of 2018 there were 2974 students
        enrolled at Hope, but now Fall 2019 there are only 2918 students
        enrolled. That is a 56 student deficit resulting in a $2,240,000 in lost
        revenue for Hope College. Only 10% of respondents chose Hope College for
        its religious identity. Campus Ministries doesn’t have a direct
        connection to the Admissions Office, but as a department on Hope’s
        Campus, the need for Campus Ministries to lead the path forward for Hope
        College has never been stronger. Campus Ministries is the Christian
        faith Hope College bases its teaching off of. Campus Ministries allows
        students to live faithfully, and into their vocations. Campus Ministries
        has evolved to be an integral part of everyday life for the student body
        of Hope College.

        <strong>3)</strong> Content produced by Hope College Campus Ministries
        is often overlooked by students, prospective students, community
        members, alumni, and other academic institutions. There is a problem of
        distribution and accessibility of the content produced by Campus
        Ministries. As a team we tackle both the distribution and accessibility
        of information as well as the quality of content being produced. Every
        other department on Hope College’s campus has an internal communication
        liaison with Public Affairs and Marketing. This position is crucial to
        the success of Campus Ministries in promoting itself across campus, West
        Michigan, and nationally.

        <strong>4)</strong> During meetings with Rev. Dr. Trygve Johnson, it was
        briefly mentioned that a longer-term, permanent partnership with Western
        Theological Seminary was part of Campus Ministries’ dream. We propose
        developing now a 20 year plan to bridge the gap between Campus
        Ministries and Western Seminary.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>5)</strong> Though Campus Ministries is our main focus, the
        department wouldn't be what it is or what it will be without the
        leadership from Trgve Johnson. To increase national visibility of Hope
        College Campus Ministries, we propose using Trygve Johnson as a human
        face to Campus Ministries. Trgve Johnson represents himself and Hope
        College. However Johnson does not have a brand that represents himself,
        or Hope College. In regards to all of Trygve Johnson’s speaking
        engagements (on and off campus), not having a brand established is
        missed opportunity for further engagements. It is setting back the
        possibility of the establishment of Campus Ministries as a national
        leader in campus ministry.
