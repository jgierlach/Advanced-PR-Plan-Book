    <p><strong>1.)</strong> The prolific volume of high quality content that Campus Ministries produces is truly impressive. CM produces places for people to gather,  resources to help nurture, and the tools to send each individual off into the world as a global citizen. It then disseminates this content across 11 different outlets and 6 different platforms that Campus Ministries currently uses to distribute the media it creates. However, the uncentralized publication of content presents a challenge of accessibility when it comes to the various publics that Campus Ministries is hoping to reach. 62% of our survey respondents do not follow any of the Campus Ministries Social Media (i.e. Campus Ministries on Twitter, Instagram, Campus Ministries Athletics and Team X, Y, or Z on Instagram). The distribution of Campus Ministries message and mission would be more effective if the channels were consolidated and branded in such a way that all their media was accessible in one place.</p>

    <p><strong>2.)</strong> “Hope College is a four-year liberal arts college where academic excellence and vibrant Christian faith join together in a supportive and welcoming community in downtown Holland, Michigan. This rare combination of deep roots and rigorous preparation equips our students to live faithfully into their vocations and make a difference in the world.” Hope College has seen a decrease in attendance from Fall 2018 to Fall 2019. In Fall of 2018 there were 2974 students enrolled at Hope, but now Fall 2019 there are only 2918 students enrolled. That is a 56 student deficit resulting in a $2,240,000 lost for Hope College. Out of the 107 responses only 12 people choose Hope for their religious aspects. Campus Ministries doesn’t have a direct connection to the admissions office, but as a department on Hope’s Campus the need for Campus Ministries to be a gold star program has never been at a stronger need. Campus Ministries is the Christian faith Hope College bases its teaching off of. Campus Ministries allows students to live faithfully, and into their vocations. Campus Ministries has  evolved to be an integral part of everyday life for the student body of Hope College.</p>

    <p><strong>3.)</strong> Content produced by Hope College Campus Ministries is often overlooked by students, prospective students, community members, alumni, and other academic institutions. There is a problem of distribution and accessibility of the content produced by Campus Ministries. As a team we are tackling both the distribution and accessibility of information as well as the quality of content being produced. Every other department on Hope College’s campus has an Internal Communication Person that communicates on behalf of the department to Public Affairs and Marketing. This position is going to be crucial to the success of publicity that Campus Ministries needs to generate.</p> 

    <p><strong>4.)</strong> To allow for other colleges to perceive the success of Hope College Campus Ministries as something their Campus Ministries can aspire to be, and model their own campus programs on, opportunity for higher education must be implemented. There is no further educational resources Campus Ministries can provide to its current students. A 20 year plan to bridge the gap between Campus Ministries and Western Seminary, generation of original worship music, and more than a church brand will fix this perceived success that Campus Ministries will be able to offer.</p> 

	  <p><strong>5.)</strong> Though Campus Ministries is our main focus, the department wouldn't be what it is or what it will be without the leadership from Trgve Johnson. To improve the perception of Hope College Campus Ministries it will need to be an internal change but also an external one. Trgve Johnson represents himself and Hope College. However Trgve does not have a brand that represents him or Hope College. In regards to all of Trygve Johnson’s speaking engagements (on and off campus), not having a brand established is missed opportunity for further engagements. It is setting back the possibility of the establishment of Campus Ministries becoming a five star program.</p>
