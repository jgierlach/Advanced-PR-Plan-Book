      <br />

      <h3>Program Goal:</h3>
      <p>
        Communicate Hope College Campus Ministries is a top-tier Christian
        program and influence admissions decisions and public perceptions of
        Hope College in a positive way.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Strategy:</h3>
      <p>
        To cultivate a Campus Ministries brand that prospective students and
        families want to engage with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope College Campus Ministries will be a name known on all Christian
        college campuses across the country within the two years from
        implementation date. Campus Ministries will establish a uniform brand
        that will increase attention and retention. The brand will be of such
        high caliber that prospective students chose Hope College based on
        wanting to be apart of the gold standard that is Campus Ministries.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Objective 1:</h3>
      <p>
        To increase by 70% Campus Ministries’ Instagram, Facebook, Twitter,
        Apple Music, YouTube, and Podcast followers by May 1 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first objective will focus on increasing engagement on multiple
        social media platforms, some of which are already used. Through the
        aesthetic and universal branding of each account, follower count will be
        increased, as will demographic of followers.

      <br />

      <h3>Tactics:</h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >#1 Increase a more aesthetically pleasing feed through strategized
          posts and a color palette</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        All posts will resemble a color palette comprised of deep navy blue,
        white, a number of light tans and grays. Majority of the most up and
        coming accounts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Apple Music, Youtube,
        and Podcast have strong brand recognition. An aesthetic pleasing feed
        that coordinates with a color palette will uniform the content which
        will increase follower attraction and retention.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >#2 Post verses/quotes/testimonies/promotions/campus introductions
          regularly (1x per day)</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Publishing and promoting engaging content such as verses will increase
        student knowledge of one of Campus Ministries’ biggest passion, the
        Bible. Publishing and promoting quotes from chapel and gathering
        services provides students a sliver of everything Campus Ministries has
        to offer at the simple touch of a finger. Publishing and promoting of
        testimonies offers insight into who has reaped the benefits of Campus
        Ministries. Publishing and promoting various promotions such as Men’s
        Night Out or Immersion trips increases the possible reach of students.
        Publishing and promoting campus introductions such as chaplains,
        students, coaches, or faculty and staff matches faces with the name of
        Campus Ministries.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >#3 Make social media outlets more accessible through promotion via
          Instagram</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Channeling all of the Campus Ministries content through one platform
        establishes a clear accessible way for students to use it as a resource.
        Each subgroup of Campus Ministries that has a modified, branded, active
        social media should be promoted in the bio of the Instagram.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >#4 Collaborate with various students, faculty, administration,
          alumni, churches, and area pastors to raise social media
          engagement</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Collaboration includes but is not limited to students, faculty,
        administration, alumni, churches, and area pastors posting in some sort
        of support of Campus Ministries. Increased support from pivotal faces of
        all corners of the community increases traction for the Campus
        Ministries brand. Public support encourages students and prospective
        students to engage.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Objective 2:</h3>
      <p>
        To increase by 5% admissions numbers by May 1, 2021 The second objective
        will seek to increase Hope College enrollment. Not Just a Church will
        implement a new portion of the tour guide training bi-annually at the
        Admissions Office. Campus Ministries social media will be presented to
        prospective and incoming freshman to increase engagement on social
        media.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Tactics:</h3>

      <p>
        <strong
          >#1 Campus Ministries staff attend the annual tour guide
          training</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        A recent drop in enrollment numbers doesn’t seem that it would influence
        Campus Ministries, but as a department of the college, if the College
        hurts each department feels a small piece of that deficit. What if
        Campus Ministries could be the key factor in helping increase enrollment
        numbers again? Tour guides for colleges can make or break the decision
        of a prospective student to accept or deny attendance. We suggest that
        Campus Ministries attend the annual tour guide training each semester to
        make sure that Campus Ministries is being pitched properly. We want to
        make sure that prospective students are being told the best things about
        Hope College I.e. Campus Ministries and can make a fully educated
        decision. Campus Ministries would share with the tour guides at the
        training what they want to be told to prospective students to hopefully
        sell them on Hope.

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >#2 Increase prospective student engagement on social media</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Campus Ministries can be found on the social media platforms Instagram,
        Facebook, Twitter, Apple Music, YouTube, and Podcast. College students
        today have strong experience on these platforms. Social Media platforms
        are huge influencers in decisions made in the current 18-22-year-old
        generation. By increasing the engagement on social media for Campus
        Ministries could result in an increased number of attendance of
        prospective students. Being able to show and demonstrate the gold star
        program that Campus Ministries presents could be a decision maker for a
        prospective student.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Objective 3:</h3>
      <p>
        To increase cross-college collaboration + marketing of Campus Ministries
        by 20% May 1 2020
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Tactics:</h3>

      <p>
        <strong
          >#1 Hire a Communications Specialist to be the liaison between the
          vision of Campus Ministries staff and Public Affairs and Marketing
          (PAM)</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Hope College Public Affairs and Marketing is a key factor to the success
        of departments on campus. Modeled after the position within the
        Development Office and Family and Alumni Engagement Office we as a team
        want Campus Ministries to create a communications specialist to be the
        liaison between the vision of Campus Ministries staff and Public Affairs
        and Marketing. Through research done on Hope’s Campus and surrounding
        colleges organization’s having a Communication Specialist is critical to
        the success of the department. Creating new channels to get across the
        message you as a program are wanting to convey is the winning element to
        a successful program.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >#2 By May 1, 2030 host a Campus Ministries Leadership
          conference</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the next ten years Campus Ministries will no longer be developing
        into a gold star program but growing its roots into the department it
        has worked hard at to become. To put the star into the gold star
        program, Campus Ministries should host a leadership conference to help
        other programs make the same growth Hope College Campus Ministries has
        in the past ten years. Though many programs hope to replicate Campus
        Ministries by what they see as an example, teaching the new generation
        of educators how to accomplish this ambitious goal will be true success
        for the program.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >#3 By May 1 2040 merge Western Seminary underneath Campus
          Ministries</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end the ultimate goal of Campus Ministries is to merge with
        Western Seminary and create Hope College Theological Center. Being able
        further educate the undergraduate minds of Hope College as well as minds
        from other colleges would be the ultimate fulfillment as a department.
        This would bring both national recognition for Campus Ministries but
        also Hope College. This would be the ultimate goal of the entire program
        and campaign we have created.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Objective 4:</h3>
      <p>To increase by 5% Trygve’s brand recognition by August 31, 2021</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Tactics:</h3>

      <p>
        <strong
          >#1 The Communication Specialist will manage and run all of Trygve’s
          social media accounts to best leverage his personal brand to promote
          Campus Ministries</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        In our analysis of Campus Ministries web presence they’re producing a
        lot of content, but not releasing it to the public in the most effective
        way possible. A Communications Specialist will be able to streamline all
        of the content Campus Ministries is producing across all of their
        various platforms in a coherent and accessible way. The Communication
        Specialist will be in charge of Trygve’s social media as well as the
        social media of Campus Ministries. This will allow them to use both
        social media brands to work together in supporting the mutual growth and
        benefit of the other.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >#2 Promote his personal and Campus Ministries accounts via visual aid
          during speaking engagements on and off campus</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        This may seem obvious but we believe it would be effective to have a
        background/visual aid for Trygve at his speaking engagements that
        promote his personal social media accounts. With the amount of speaking
        and events he does every year, he is getting in front of thousands of
        people who have the potential to be followers of the Trygve and Campus
        Ministries Brand. Giving them an easy and straightforward way to engage
        with Trygve and Campus Ministries during and after his talk will be a
        great way to increase Trygve’s brand recognition.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><strong>#3 Create/update Trygve’s personal website</strong></p>
      <p>
        This to us felt like necessary brand policing and control. Trygve’s
        personal website will be home to all relevant things Trygve does for
        Campus Ministries, and will serve as a way for his followers and fans to
        be constantly engaging with his work.
