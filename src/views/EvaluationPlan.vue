      Not Just a Church focuses on the hiring of a Communication Specialist for
      the department to focus on a revamp of Campus Ministries social media. We
      condensed Campus Ministry social media accounts in order to increase
      accessibility for external audiences who are perhaps not familiar with the
      various worship bands or the cottages. The Communication Specialist will
      be a huge key in the success of the social media campaign.

    <p>
      To determine and measure how successful the Not Just a Church campaign has
      been, we will measure the numbers from current social media followers to
      the numbers after the campaign has ended. Increased presence and influence
      on social media in turn increases Campus Ministriesâ€™ relevance on campus.
      Campus Ministries current social media followers are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Instagram 835 followers</li>
      <li>Facebook 1462 likes</li>
      <li>Twitter 1392 followers</li>
      <li>YouTube 0 subscribers</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <p>
      Over the next year, Campus Ministries should strive to have social media
      accounts up by 70 percent. This means that Instagram should be at or
      around 1420 followers, Facebook page likes at 2486, Twitter at 2367
      followers and YouTube should have 70 subscribers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also want to determine how much this social media campaign changes the
      perceptions of Campus Ministries. A major aspect of our campaign hinges on
      the hiring of a Communication Specialist. Most of the implementation will
      be done by the Communication Specialist. To measure this, we will compare
      the amount of attendance. If Chapel and The Gathering increase by 10% this
      will be a show of success. We will also look at if there is an increase in
      attendance in Bible studies and events hosted by Campus Ministries. If
      Campus Ministries can get an increase in 10% of Bible study and event
      attendees, this campaign will be successful.

      The Not Just a Church campaign is to increase attendance and followers for
      Campus Ministries. This campaign will engage Hope College students,
      faculty, and staff as well as outside publics in the Holland and
      surrounding communities. Campus Ministries offers a lot of tools to help
      in the success of educational and spiritual growth and we at PR Evolve
      want to help get Campus Ministries there.
