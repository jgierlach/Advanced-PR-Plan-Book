    <h2>The prolific volume of high quality content that Campus Ministries produces is truly impressive. However, there is a challenge of accessibility when it comes to the various publics that Campus Ministries is preaching too. We counted 13 different outlets and 6 different platforms that Campus Ministries currently uses to distribute the media they create. The distribution of Campus Ministries message and mission would be more effective if the channels were consolidated and branded in such a way that all their media was accessible in one place.</h2>
