        <strong>Program Goal:</strong> Communicate Hope College Campus
        Ministries is a top-tier Christian community and influences admissions
        and public perceptions of Hope College in a positive way.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Strategy:</strong> To cultivate a Campus Ministries brand that
        prospective students and families want to engage with.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong>Objective 1:</strong> To increase by 70% CM Instagram, Facebook,
        Twitter, Apple Music, Youtube, and Podcast followers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tactics:</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#1:</strong> Increase a more aesthetically pleasing feed through
        strategized posts and a color palette
      </p>

      <p>
        All posts will resemble a color palette comprised of deep navy blue,
        white, a number of light tans and grays. Majority of the most up and
        coming accounts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Apple Music, Youtube,
        and Podcast have strong brand recognition. An aesthetic pleasing feed
        that coordinates with a color palette will uniform the content which
        will increase follower attraction and retention.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#2:</strong> Post verses/quotes/testimonies/promotions/campus
        introductions regularly (1x per day)
      </p>

      <p>
        Publishing and promoting engaging content such as verses will increase
        student knowledge of one of Campus Ministries’ biggest passion, the
        Bible. Publishing and promoting quotes from chapel and gathering
        services provides students a sliver of everything Campus Ministries has
        to offer at the simple touch of a finger. Publishing and promoting of
        testimonies offers insight into who has reaped the benefits of Campus
        Ministries. Publishing and promoting various promotions such as Men’s
        Night Out or Immersion trips increases the possible reach of students.
        Publishing and promoting campus introductions such as chaplains,
        students, coaches, or faculty and staff matches faces with the name of
        Campus Ministries.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#3:</strong> Make social media outlets more accessible through
        promotion via Instagram
      </p>

      <p>
        Channeling all of the Campus Ministries content through one platform
        establishes a clear accessible way for students to use it as a resource.
        Each subgroup of Campus Ministries that has a modified, branded, active
        social media should be promoted in the bio of the Instagram.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#4:</strong> Collaborate with various students, faculty,
        administration, alumni, churches, and area pastors to raise social media
        engagement
      </p>

      <p>
        Collaboration includes but is not limited to students, faculty,
        administration, alumni, churches, and area pastors posting in some sort
        of support of Campus Ministries. Increased support from pivotal faces of
        all corners of the community increases traction for the Campus
        Ministries brand. Public support encourages students and prospective
        students to engage.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong>Objective 2:</strong> To increase by 5% admissions numbers by
        May 1, 2021
      </p>

      <p>
        The second objective will seek to increase Hope College enrollment. Not
        Just a Church will implement a new portion of the tour guide training
        bi-annually at the Admissions Office. Campus Ministries social media
        will be presented to prospective and incoming freshman to increase
        engagement on social media.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tactics:</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#1:</strong> Campus Ministries staff attend the annual tour
        guide training
      </p>

      <p>
        A recent drop in enrollment numbers doesn’t seem that it would influence
        Campus Ministries, but as a department of the college, if the College
        hurts each department feels a small piece of that deficit. What if
        Campus Ministries could be the key factor in helping increase enrollment
        numbers again? Tour guides for colleges can make or break the decision
        of a prospective student to accept or deny attendance. We suggest that
        Campus Ministries attend the annual tour guide training each semester to
        make sure that Campus Ministries is being pitched properly. We want to
        make sure that prospective students are being told the best things about
        Hope College I.e. Campus Ministries and can make a fully educated
        decision. Campus Ministries would share with the tour guides at the
        training what they want to be told to prospective students to hopefully
        sell them on Hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#2:</strong> Increase prospective student engagement on social
        media
      </p>

      <p>
        Campus Ministries can be found on the social media platforms Instagram,
        Facebook, Twitter, Apple Music, YouTube, and Podcast. College students
        today have strong experience on these platforms. Social Media platforms
        are huge influencers in decisions made in the current 18-22-year-old
        generation. By increasing the engagement on social media for Campus
        Ministries could result in an increased number of attendance of
        prospective students. Being able to show and demonstrate the gold star
        program that Campus Ministries presents could be a decision maker for a
        prospective student.

      <p>
        <strong>Objective 3:</strong> To increase cross-college collaboration +
        marketing of Campus Ministries by 20%
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tactics:</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#1:</strong> Hire a Communications Specialist to be the liaison
        between the vision of Campus Ministries staff and Public Affairs and
        Marketing (PAM)
      </p>

      <p>
        Hope College Public Affairs and Marketing is a key factor to success of
        departments on campus. Modeled after the position within the Development
        Office and Family and Alumni Engagement Office we as a team want Campus
        Ministries to create a communications specialist to be the liaison
        between the vision of Campus Ministries staff and Public Affairs and
        Marketing. Through research done on Hope’s Campus and surrounding
        colleges organization’s having a Communication Specialist is critical to
        the success of the department. Creating new channels to get across the
        message you as a program are wanting to convey is the winning element to
        a successful program.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#2:</strong> By May 1, 2030 host a Campus Ministries Leadership
        conference
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the next ten years Campus Ministries will no longer be developing
        into a gold star program but growing its roots into the department it
        has worked hard at to become. To put the star into the gold star
        program, Campus Ministries should host a leadership conference to help
        other programs make the same growth Hope College Campus Ministries has
        in the past ten years. Though many programs hope to replicate Campus
        Ministries by what they see as an example, teaching the new generation
        of educators how to accomplish this ambitious goal will be true success
        for the program.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>#3:</strong> By May 1 2040 merge Western Seminary underneath
        Campus Ministries
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end the ultimate goal of Campus Ministries is to merge with
        Western Seminary and create Hope College Theological Center. Being able
        further educate the undergraduate minds of Hope College as well as minds
        from other colleges would be the ultimate fulfillment as a department.
        This would bring both national recognition for Campus Ministries but
        also Hope College. This would be the ultimate goal of the entire program
        and campaign we have created.
