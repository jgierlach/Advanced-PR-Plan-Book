    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <br />

    <p>

    <p>
      <strong>Objective 2:</strong> To increase by 5% admissions numbers by May 1, 2021
    </p>

    <p>The second objective will seek to increase Hope College enrollment. Not Just a Church will implement a new portion of the tour guide training bi-annually at the Admissions Office. Campus Ministries social media will be presented to prospective and incoming freshman to increase engagement on social media.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tactics:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>#1:</strong> Campus Ministries staff attend the annual tour guide
      training
    </p>

    <p>A recent drop in enrollment numbers doesn’t seem that it would influence Campus Ministries, but as a department of the college, if the College hurts each department feels a small piece of that deficit. What if Campus Ministries could be the key factor in helping increase enrollment numbers again? Tour guides for colleges can make or break the decision of a prospective student to accept or deny attendance. We suggest that Campus Ministries attend the annual tour guide training each semester to make sure that Campus Ministries is being pitched properly. We want to make sure that prospective students are being told the best things about Hope College I.e. Campus Ministries and can make a fully educated decision. Campus Ministries would share with the tour guides at the training what they want to be told to prospective students to hopefully sell them on Hope.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>#2:</strong> Increase prospective student engagement on social media
    </p>

    <p>Campus Ministries can be found on the social media platforms Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Apple Music, YouTube, and Podcast. College students today have strong experience on these platforms. Social Media platforms are huge influencers in decisions made in the current 18-22-year-old generation. By increasing the engagement on social media for Campus Ministries could result in an increased number of attendance of prospective students. Being able to show and demonstrate the gold star program that Campus Ministries presents could be a decision maker for a prospective student.</p>

      <strong>Objective 3:</strong> To increase cross-college collaboration + marketing of Campus Ministries by 20%
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tactics:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>#1:</strong> Hire a Communications Specialist to be the liaison
      between the vision of Campus Ministries staff and Public Affairs and Marketing (PAM)
    </p>

    <p>Hope College Public Affairs and Marketing is a key factor to success of departments on campus. Modeled after the position within the Development Office and Family and Alumni Engagement Office we as a team want Campus Ministries to create a communications specialist to be the liaison between the vision of Campus Ministries staff and Public Affairs and Marketing. Through research done on Hope’s Campus and surrounding colleges organization’s having a Communication Specialist is critical to the success of the department. Creating new channels to get across the message you as a program are wanting to convey is the winning element to a successful program.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>#2:</strong> By May 1, 2030 host a Campus Ministries Leadership conference
    </p>

    <p>Over the next ten years Campus Ministries will no longer be developing into a gold star program but growing its roots into the department it has worked hard at to become. To put the star into the gold star program, Campus Ministries should host a leadership conference to help other programs make the same growth Hope College Campus Ministries has in the past ten years. Though many programs hope to replicate Campus Ministries by what they see as an example, teaching the new generation of educators how to accomplish this ambitious goal will be true success for the program.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>#3:</strong> By May 1 2040 merge Western Seminary underneath Campus Ministries
    </p>

    <p>In the end the ultimate goal of Campus Ministries is to merge with Western Seminary and create Hope College Theological Center. Being able further educate the undergraduate minds of Hope College as well as minds from other colleges would be the ultimate fulfillment as a department. This would bring both national recognition for Campus Ministries but also Hope College. This would be the ultimate goal of the entire program and campaign we have created.</p>
