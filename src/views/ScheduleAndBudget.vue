        Most of our budget would be allocated towards hiring of a Communication
        Specialist to join the campus ministries team.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Communication Specialist would be there to guide and oversee the
        content being curated on all of Campus Ministries Social Media and
        outreach channels, as well as a direct Liaison between Campus Ministries
        and Public Affairs Marketing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although this would be a large expense with a salary range of around
        40-60,000 year, we believe this role will pay dividends in uniting and
        policing the Campus Ministries Brand in a cohesive way.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a cohesive and well managed Campus Ministries brand working in sync
        with Hopeâ€™s own Public Affairs Marketing we anticipate that all of the
        objectives we have outlined under our program goal will be attainable.
